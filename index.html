    Instructions:
  </h4>
  <p class="writing"><strong class="steps">Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Line three 8-inch cake pans with parchment rounds and spray parchment and sides of pans generously with nonstick cooking spray
    <br><br>
    <strong class="steps">Step 2:</strong>In a glass measuring cup, whisk the hot coffee and cocoa powder. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="steps">Step 3:</strong>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
    <br><br>
   <strong class="steps">Step 4:</strong>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, vegetable oil, and melted butter. Add in the eggs and yolk and whisk for twenty seconds, or until very well combined. Add in the buttermilk, vanilla and food coloring and whisk to combine. Whisk in the vinegar and coffee mixture. Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the flour mixture into the batter in three additions, whisking until each addition is incorporated.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="steps">Step 5:</strong>Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans. Tap the bottoms of the pans against the counter several times to release any air bubbles.
    <br><br>
    <strong class="steps">Step 6:</strong>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick comes out clean. It‚Äôs normal for the cake to look slightly spongy on top. Place the cake pans on cooling racks. When the pans are cool enough to touch, run a thin knife around the edges of the pans to loosen the cakes. Invert onto the wire racks. Let cool completely.

    Ingredients Quantity:
  </h4>
  <p class="writing">
Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
    <br>
Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together
    <br>
    Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
    <br>
Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
    <br>
Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.
    <br>
Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.
    <br>
Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.
    <br>
Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
    <br>
Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.
